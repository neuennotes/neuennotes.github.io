          "I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Eric for a long time. We have shared many musical notes together on stage. He is a fantastic pianist and his passion for music is very strong. Which is why he is such a talented piano technician. He came to my house and spent time getting to know my piano and really paid special attention to the details of getting not only a gorgeous sound, but also to feel and play like it was brand new! I have had this piano for several years and it has been moved a few times. I have always found it to be a little stiff for a Yamaha. However after Eric’s magical touch, she plays effortlessly. I highly recommend Eric to tune or service your piano. He takes extra special care, and it shows.",
